    <h1>Project 1: </h1>
    <h2>Monopoly</h2>
    <h4 id="monopoly">This is a version of the board game, Monopoly, created using python. But wait! There's a twist. We're putting our own spin to the game by accounting for inflation. The more money players earn, the higher the prices go! The goal of this project is to explore how python works. In order to create the board for the game, we first used turtle in order to get a general idea of how it would look like. After making this, we switched over to pygame and remade the board. This was because we learned that we couldn't connect turtle and pygame together. After creating the board, we started developing the mechanics of the game. First, we created a dice system that would add the results of two dice to come up with how many spaces a player could move. Then, we made the characters that the players would control. We were able to create a movement system that was linked to the dice system, allowing for the pieces to move according to their dice role. As of now, we have created two characters for the player to move. We plan on adding the following mechanics to the game including, but not limited to: a system to determine whose turn it is, the properties that the players will buy, a jail, a monetary system, and the chance and community chest cards. </h4>
